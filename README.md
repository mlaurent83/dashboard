# Overview
This dashboard app was created to further learn and apply my React skills to a project. It features a lot of tools: calendar, kanban, editor and color-picker and charts: pie, line, area, bar, financial, pyramid, stacked and color-mapping. It also contains a main dashboard and different pages with the customers, employees and orders.
